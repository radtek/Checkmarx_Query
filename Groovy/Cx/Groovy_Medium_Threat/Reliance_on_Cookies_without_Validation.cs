/*
Here we find any permission that is set by a cookie value.
We will deal with 3 different cases:
1. The simplest - a direct (data) inlfuence of the cookie on the permission
2. A bit more complex - a control influence of a cookie on the permission
3. The most complex case - a control influence of a variable, 
						   that was control influenced by a cookie, 
						   on the permission
Since we currently don't have control influence, we will "simulate" it by checking "if" statement conditions.
