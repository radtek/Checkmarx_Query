// Query Methods_Without_ReturnType
// ////////////////////////////////
// The purpose of this query is to find the functions/methods that are not defined with any type.
// Example:
// foo(){ } should be recognized as bad code practice
// ==============================================================================================

// The methodDecls variable will keep the list of all Method Declarations

// The method that has no returned type defined such as
// "foo(){ }" is kept in the DOM like "int foo(){ }"
CxList intMethodDecls = methodDecls.FindByReturnType("int");

//There are 4 types of method declaration selected so far:
// 1) int f1() 	 	- return type is kept in DOM as int
// 2) f2()   		- return type is kept in DOM as int
// 3) int * f3()   	- return type is kept in DOM as int*
// 4) int ** f4()   - return type is kept in DOM as int**
//
// From the list above, only f2() should be selected.
