/* Given two sets of paths, say X and Y, return the set 
   resulting from composing each path in Y with each path in X.

   We define the composition of paths as follows. 
   Let A = a_1, a_2, ..., a_n be a path starting at node a_1 and ending at node a_n.
   Let B = b_1, b_2, ..., b_m be another path with a similar structure.
   The composition of B with A is defined as the path
   (0) a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, b_2, ..., b_m          , if a_n == b_1
   (1) undefined                                  , otherwise.
