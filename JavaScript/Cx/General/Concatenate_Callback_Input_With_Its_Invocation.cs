/* Consider a method declaration M and a flow path starting at one of
   M's parameter declaration, say h, like so:

   (0)    function M (..., h, ...) { ... }
   
   where there is some flow path starting at h, say h->a_1->....->a_n.

   Consider further that there are (in the source-code) method invocations
   where the symbol M occurs as a parameter, like so:

   (1)    someObject.someMethod(..., M, ...)

   This query's purpose is then to return the flow path starting at M
   in (1), followed by M in (0), followed by h->a_1->...->a_n.

                          * * *

   param[0]            : a set of h->a_1->...->a_n flows.
   param[1] (Optional) : a set of occurrences of M as a parameter to other method.
