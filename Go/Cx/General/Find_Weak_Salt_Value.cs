/*
* This Query will find all salts used in the given encryption that may be insucure. The
*  query make sure the salt (the array) has a minimum size of 32 and is randomized
*  through "crypto/rand", so it will alert all situations where the salt is weak and
*  used in the given encrypt method.
*
* How it works: It will find flows from the array creation to the scrypt encryption,
*  filtering those (the sanitizers) which the array used as salt is randomized and with
*  acceptable size.
*
* 	package 		- The name of the package 
*	method 			- The name of the method
