/*
* This query finds potential Denial of Service on the following situations:
*  - If theres an input that can affect a loop, this can cause big loops, that 
*   	may be problematic when allocating memory for example, like being out of memory;
*  - If there are pointers that can be influenced by inputs, that situation may
*      potential problems of memory access for that instance, ie accessing OS mem
*      will do a segmentation violation. 
*  - If there are array or slices access that may be influenced by inputs, they will
*      be marked as result because there's a potencial of buffer overflow
*  - If there's a DoS by sleep, a situation when an input is influencing a time.sleep
*      and the program may be sleeping for a while.
